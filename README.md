# Cloud-Projects
This repository contains my implementation of learnings and different cloud services that I explore. It includes hands-on practice, projects, and implementations of various AWS services. The projects in this repo are based on AWS CSP. In the future, I will try to implement different projects in a multi-cloud setup when it feels right to go multi-cloud.
